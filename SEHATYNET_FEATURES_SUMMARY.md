# SehatyNet+ Patient Medical Profile & Dashboard Improvements

## 1. Doctor Dashboard: Patient Tab
- Added a tabbed layout for the doctor dashboard.
- Enhanced the Patients tab to show a detailed patient profile, including:
  - Contact info, CNAM ID, gender, address, and emergency contact (now inline in the profile card).
  - Medical information (allergies, medications, medical history) and medical records.
- Ensured the doctor sees the full, up-to-date patient profile by fetching the latest data from the backend.

## 2. Medical Information Q&A Modal (Onboarding & Dashboard Prompt)
- Implemented a step-by-step Q&A modal for patients to fill out their medical information (allergies, medications, chronic conditions).
- Added an introduction to the modal explaining the purpose and privacy of the questions.
- Ensured the modal appears after registration/first login if medical info is missing, and as a dashboard prompt until completed.
- Fixed modal logic so it closes immediately after saving, with a toast notification for success or error.

## 3. Profile Page Enhancements
- Updated the patient profile page to:
  - Display and allow editing of allergies, current medications, and medical history as separate, comma-separated fields.
  - Sync these fields with the Q&A modal and backend, so updates are reflected everywhere.
- Ensured the profile page uses the correct field names and formats for backend compatibility.

## 4. Bug Fixes & Best Practices
- Fixed critical bugs with modal state, function scoping, and duplicate handler definitions.
- Ensured all stateful handlers (like `handleSaveMedicalInfo`) are defined inside their components.
- Used React Query's `refetch` to update user data after profile changes, avoiding full page reloads.
- Added toast notifications for user feedback on profile updates.

## 5. User Experience & Data Consistency
- Provided a best-practice, user-friendly onboarding and profile completion flow.
- Ensured all medical information is collected, displayed, and editable in a consistent, reliable way for both patients and providers.
