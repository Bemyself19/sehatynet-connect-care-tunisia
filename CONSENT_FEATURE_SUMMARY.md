# Medical Records Consent Feature Implementation

## Overview
We've implemented a comprehensive consent system that allows patients to control whether other doctors can view their medical records during consultations.

## Key Features

### 1. Doctor-Specific Filtering
- **LiveConsultation.tsx**: Now only shows medical records and notes from the current consulting doctor
- Doctors only see records they created unless patient grants broader consent
- Uses filtered API calls with `doctorId` parameter

### 2. Patient Consent Toggle
- **Profile.tsx**: Added a consent toggle in patient profile under Medical Information section
- Patients can grant/revoke access for other doctors to view their complete medical history
- Real-time updates with proper feedback messages

### 3. Backend Implementation
- **User Model**: Added `allowOtherDoctorsAccess` boolean field
- **Medical Record Controller**: Updated to filter records based on doctor and consent
- **Auth Controller**: Added consent update endpoint
- **Routes**: Added `/users/me/consent` PUT endpoint

### 4. API Updates
- **api.ts**: Added new methods:
  - `getDoctorNotes(patientId, doctorId?)` - filtered notes
  - `getDoctorOnlyMedicalRecords(patientId, doctorId?)` - filtered records
  - `updateMedicalRecordConsent(allowAccess)` - consent management

### 5. Multilingual Support
- Added translations in English, French, and Arabic for:
  - Medical Records Access
  - Consent descriptions
  - Success/error messages
  - Access granted/restricted states

## Privacy Protection

### Default Behavior
- By default, patients' medical records are private to their treating doctors only
- Each doctor can only see records they created during their consultations

### With Consent
- When patient enables consent, other doctors can view complete medical history
- Provides better continuity of care while respecting patient privacy

### Security Features
- Consent can be revoked at any time
- Clear messaging about what access is granted
- Audit trail maintained through existing user update system

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `src/pages/appointments/LiveConsultation.tsx` - Doctor-filtered data fetching
- `src/pages/profile/Profile.tsx` - Consent toggle interface
- `src/lib/api.ts` - New API methods
- `src/types/user.ts` - Updated User interface
- Translation files - All language support

### Backend
- `backend/src/models/user.model.ts` - Added consent field
- `backend/src/controllers/medicalRecord.controller.ts` - Filtering logic
- `backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts` - Consent endpoint
- `backend/src/routes/user.routes.ts` - New route

## Usage

### For Patients
1. Go to Profile â†’ Medical Information
2. Find "Medical Records Access" section
3. Toggle consent on/off as desired
4. Receive confirmation of changes

### For Doctors
1. During live consultation, patient information section automatically shows:
   - Records from current doctor (always visible)
   - Records from other doctors (only if patient granted consent)
2. Privacy is maintained without requiring additional permissions

## Benefits
- Enhanced patient privacy control
- Better doctor workflow during consultations
- Compliance with medical privacy standards
- Transparent consent management
- Multilingual accessibility
